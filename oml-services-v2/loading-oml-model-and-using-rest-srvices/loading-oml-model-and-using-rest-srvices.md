# Loading an OML model in OML Services and using it

In this section of the workshop we will import and store the Decision Tree model in our OML Services repository and score it using REST APIs

Estimated Time: 20 minutes

### Objectives
We are going to run the next steps:
* Extract the saved model to a file;
* Store the model in the OML Services repository;
* Deploy the model;
* Score a customer using the Decision Tree model;


### Prerequisites
* Autonomous Database created
* OML user created in Autonomous database
* ``DTModel.mod`` on the VM

## 
## Task: 1: Store the model in the OML Services repository

*  In the Postman session opened run the following Get method to get the list of models deployed.

````
Operation: GET

URI endpoint:
<copy>https://<oml-cloud-service-location-url>.oraclecloudapps.com/omlmod/v1/models</copy>

````
 - Replace **`<oml-cloud-service-location-url>`** with your URL saved in chapter "Scoring OML model using OML Services" Task 1.2: Authorize OML Services User

 In the Authorization tab pick **Bearer Token** and paste the token copied from *Scoring OML using OML Services Task 1*.

 ![Model Import](images/model-import-06.jpg)

The response is just the **SVMG** model we used in our previous tasks.

In case you get the Expired Token Error, rerun the generate Token command explained in **Scoring OML using Rest Services: Task 1**.

* Open a new tab in Postman and run the following POST command to store the model in OML Services repository.

````
Operation: POST

URI endpoint:
<copy>https://<oml-cloud-service-location-url>.oraclecloudapps.com/omlmod/v1/models</copy>

````
 - Replace **`<oml-cloud-service-location-url>`** with your URL saved.

 In the Authorization tab pick **Bearer Token** and the token is pre-filled.

 ![Model Import](images/model-import-08.jpg)

In the Headers tab enter the following:

````
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
boundary: Boundary
````

  ![Model Import](images/model-import-09.jpg)


In the Body tab pick form-data and enter `modelData` in the key field, hover over the right side of the field and pick File in the dropdown.

  ![Model Import](images/model-import-10.jpg)

Click Select File; go to `/home/oracle/OML-Services/` folder and select the **`DTModel.mod`** file created earlier.

  ![Model Import](images/model-import-11.jpg)

Add the next keys in the Body tab and click Send.

````
 modelName=DTModel
 modelType=OML
 version=1.0
````
  ![Model Import](images/model-import-12.jpg)

The response is that the model is created.

 ![Model Import](images/model-import-13.jpg)

Copy the **`modelId`** displayed in the JSON response.


## Task: 2: Deploy the model

* Open a new tab in Postman and run the following POST command to deploy the model in Autonomous Database.

````
Operation: POST

URI endpoint:
<copy>https://<oml-cloud-service-location-url>.oraclecloudapps.com/omlmod/v1/deployment</copy>

````
 - Replace **`<oml-cloud-service-location-url>`** with your URL saved.


In the Authorization tab pick **Bearer Token** and the token is pre-filled.

  ![Model Deploy](images/model-import-14.jpg)  

In the Headers tab enter the following:

````
Content-Type: application/json
````

  ![Model Deploy](images/model-import-15.jpg)

 In the Body tab enter the following JSON:

````
 {
   "uri":"dtmodel",
   "modelId":"50ffc903-aaf6-4a94-a228-4cb7ab6b3c07"
}
````

Where `50ffc903-aaf6-4a94-a228-4cb7ab6b3c07` is the model Id copied from the previous step. Replace it with the returned model Id from your command in Task 6.2.

The URI **`dtmodel`** we are going to use in the Task 6.4 when scoring the data against our model.

And the result is:

 ![Model Deploy](images/model-import-17.jpg)

The next step is to score a customer.


## Task: 3: Score a customer using the Decision Tree model

In this step we are going to score Fran Hobbs against our Decision Tree imported model.

Enter the following details:

````
Operation: POST

URI endpoint:
<copy>https://<oml-cloud-service-location-url>.oraclecloudapps.com/omlmod/v1/deployment/<model_URI>/score </copy>

````
- Replace **`<oml-cloud-service-location-url>`** with your URL saved.

 - Replace **`<model_URI>`** with the model URI that we defined in previous task: **`dtmodel`**

In the Authorization tab pick **Bearer Token** and the token is pre-filled.

In the header Tab enter the details:

````
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'

````

  ![Model Score](images/model-import-19.jpg)  


In the Body tab enter the Fran Hobs data in RAW format. Notice that we are not providing any of the ``LTV`` or ``LTV_BIN`` data, but provide fully the other important data

````
<copy>
{
   "inputRecords":[
      {
         "CUST_ID":"CU12350",
         "LAST":"FRAN",
         "FIRST":"HOBBS",
         "STATE":"NV",
         "REGION":"Southwest",
         "SEX":"F",
         "PROFESSION":"Programmer/Developer",
         "BUY_INSURANCE":"No",
         "AGE":21,
         "HAS_CHILDREN":0,
         "SALARY":66180,
         "N_OF_DEPENDENTS":5,
         "CAR_OWNERSHIP":1,
         "HOUSE_OWNERSHIP":0,
         "TIME_AS_CUSTOMER":5,
         "MARITAL_STATUS":"SINGLE",
         "CREDIT_BALANCE":0,
         "BANK_FUNDS":500,
         "CHECKING_AMOUNT":185,
         "MONEY_MONTLY_OVERDRAWN":53.21,
         "T_AMOUNT_AUTOM_PAYMENTS":197,
         "MONTHLY_CHECKS_WRITTEN":4,
         "MORTGAGE_AMOUNT":0,
         "N_TRANS_ATM":3,
         "N_MORTGAGES":0,
         "N_TRANS_TELLER":2,
         "CREDIT_CARD_LIMITS":2500,
         "N_TRANS_KIOSK":4,
         "N_TRANS_WEB_BANK":0
      }
   ]
}
</copy>
````

Click Send

  ![Model Score](images/model-import-20.jpg)  

Notice the response for this scoring.

  ![Model Score](images/model-import-21.jpg)  

In this case the percentages are different but it still has the highest probability to be in the **LOW** category as it was in our Support Vector Machine Gaussian model.
